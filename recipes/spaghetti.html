        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Great simple pasta dish. Good to have the night before a race. This is also good with sauteed shrimp.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
            <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, cut into 1/4 inch pieces</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, 
                stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
                until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the bacon, and cook until the bacon has begun to shrink, 
                about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, and continue cooking and stirring until the garlic has softened, and the bacon is crisp, about 5 minutes. 
                Toss the drained pasta with the bacon, oil, and parsley to serve.</li>
        </ol>
